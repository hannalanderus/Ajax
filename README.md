# Async & API

## About
A page where you can read about Marvel comics, containing specific characters.



## About the API
[MarvelÂ´s API](https://marvel.com/) gives you information about all their comics, characters, creators etc.


## Working process
First step were to pick the API and after that to build a basic structure in html. 
Next step were to print different data from the API. My first wish were to find ONE list over ALL characters but that wasent possible, so i decided to pick out 4 characters that i wanted more information about. For example a list over comics containing the Iron man, showing title, description, price and image. 
After that i made it possible to search on the different characters that i decided to use and printed images on the landing page.
Last step - styling.

## Improvements :heavy_exclamation_mark:
* Reduce code redundancy
* Show the loader in every stage.
* Better comments.
* Nicer design


## To Dos :bangbang:
* Sort on price.
* Remove posts with missing information such as price, description or image.
* Print only one image on the landing page, selecting a random picture from the image list.
